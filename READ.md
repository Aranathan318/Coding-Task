# To-Do List

## Description
The To-Do List is a simple command-line application that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, view pending and completed tasks, and delete tasks. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as file handling, JSON serialization, and user interaction in Python.
